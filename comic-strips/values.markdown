    Child is playing on a smartphone
    Parent: Hey, what are you playing?
    Child: Excellia Fantasy.
    Parent: The mobile F2P?
    Child: Yeah.
    Parent: With MICRO-TRANSACTIONS?!
    Child: I never buy anything.
    Parent: Then you must be watching lots of ads!
    Child: Don't worry, dad, there are no ads. It's a gacha game!
    Parent: WHAT?!
    Child: Wanna try?
    Parent: *Ahem* Listen, son... Why not grab that $60 RPG you wanted while it's fresh?
    Parent: It's not like the eShop's gonna put it on sale any time soon...
    Child: Yeah, why not?
    Parent: Great! Let me connect to the family account
    Parent leaves whistling
    Child drops the smartphone
    Child: Sometimes it's just too easy.

    Thanks to Malcolm in the Middle
