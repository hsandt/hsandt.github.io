    How developers see game engines
    - Ah, right. Initialization order matters.
    - So slow.
    - Why is the shader not compiling?
    - Why was my data not exported?!

    How players see game engines
    - Nice graphics!

I didn't have my graphics tablet so I experimented with vector art (easier to control with the mouse) this time. I'm conflicted with the results. I still prefer drawing by hand, whether on paper or with the tablet.
