    Crash 1
    Uh, what happened?
    I should send a crash report...

    Crash 2
    Hm, that's annoying. I'll send another report hoping they can fix it
    just a short one

    Crash 3
    You know what?
    The deadline is tomorrow, and I don't think they'll fix it by then
    close and restart
