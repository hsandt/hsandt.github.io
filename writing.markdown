Here is a collection of various works of writing I made over time.

### Good old days

I still remember how would gently make me slide into the slot<br>
Until I click, ready to be challenged.<br>
<br>
When I was ill, you would blow into my fragile circuits,<br>
So I can heal, and play the starting jingle again.<br>
<br>
On sunny days, you would put me in your bag and bring me<br>
To your friend's house for entire Sundays.<br>
<br>
The first time you pulled me out of the shiny cardboard box,<br>
Brand new plastic I was smelling, and you hands were still shaking,<br>
As you pressed the Power On button.<br>
<br>
Now wipe the dust out of my body<br>
And feel the thrill of the old days,<br>
Until you say:<br>
‘Crap, it looked much better when I was a kid.’<br>

### The Site That Sends You Mad

I am tired of website UI that feels like nobody tested them,<br>
or maybe just shovel-hired people getting paid peanuts.<br>
Their pages are digital time machines<br>
that put you back to web 1.0, before "UX was invented",<br>
but without the excuse of having to code everything on your own.<br>
<br>
I want to give you feedback on that buggy form<br>
but Ctrl+F shows me no contact link.<br>
Ironically, the only modern feature is that chatbot,<br>
a renowned specialist in missing the point.<br>
<br>
Yes, I want to speak to a human.<br>
Ah! Finally someone who can understand me.<br>
Let's get this over with. My issue is...<br>
No, I've already read this FAQ.<br>
Your metallic assistant spammed me hyperlinks to it.<br>
<br>
Oh, you have to stop working now,<br>
so someone else will continue our talk?<br>
Fine, but they are asking me the same questions all over again.<br>
I'll let them read what we've just discussed instead.<br>
<br>
... It's taking quite a lot of time...<br>
Sorry, I have to go to sleep myself.<br>
Maybe we can meet another day<br>
to solve this issue,<br>
if you don't go amnesic all over again.<br>
<br>
Okay, how do I copy the chat content<br>
so I can back it up somewhere for later?<br>
I'll just highlight the text with my mouse...<br>
Oh no! Releasing the button outside the chat window closed it!!<br>

### Rival

Waiting for my rival<br>
I'm facing the *goban* alone<br>
Studying patterns from the book<br>
And preparing my strategy<br>
<br>
Will that make the difference?<br>
This opponent is tough<br>
But the board is the neutral referee<br>
I got my chances<br>
<br>
Quarter to two<br>
Almost time to go back to class<br>
Once more, he didn't come<br>
And will probably never again<br>
<br>
Why am I still here?<br>
Because I have to<br>
I'm the club leader<br>
I'll stay here until the close<br>

### Iron first

Today I ironed my clothes for the first time<br>
I had enough of looking like a *hikikomori*<br>
— Although I probably am —<br>
Now, no wrinkles, my shirt is smooth<br>
It looks good on me, and it's warm<br>
I finally understand what my mother meant<br>
<br>
❧❧❧<br>
<br>
It has been three months since I haven't touched the iron<br>
I had to work hard to balance the *gacha*<br>
— So no time left to spend on futility —<br>
My shirt is full of ripples, but I do know the trick<br>
During video calls, I tilt the camera so it only shows my face<br>
This is enough for me<br>
But I miss the warmth of ironed clothes<br>
