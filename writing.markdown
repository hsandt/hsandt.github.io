Here is a collection of various works of writing I made over time.

### Good old days

I still remember how would gently make me slide into the slot<br>
Until I click, ready to be challenged.<br>
<br>
When I was ill, you would blow into my fragile circuits,<br>
So I can heal, and play the starting jingle again.<br>
<br>
On sunny days, you would put me in your bag and bring me<br>
To your friend's house for entire Sundays.<br>
<br>
The first time you pulled me out of the shiny cardboard box,<br>
Brand new plastic I was smelling, and you hands were still shaking,<br>
As you pressed the Power On button.<br>
<br>
Now wipe the dust out of my body<br>
And feel the thrill of the old days,<br>
Until you say:<br>
‘Crap, it looked much better when I was a kid.’<br>
