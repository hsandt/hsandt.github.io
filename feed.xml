<p>My latest addition is moving enemies. They currently move at half the speed of the player snake, but they still make the game significantly harder: new enemies regularly spawn and keep coming at you, and touching them causes instant game over. You can trick them by repeatedly warping to the other side of the arena, but I may eventually fix this by making enemies aware of edge warping to find the real shortest distance to player snake.</p>

<p>One problem is inherent to snake: you cannot control the tail, so it is very vulnerable, even more as your snake gets longer. I may mitigate this by reducing penalty when a body part other than the head hits an enemy.</p>

I’m regularly downloading new snapshots of Godot 4 beta which sometimes introduces breaking API changes, but I hope it will be worth it when it finally gets released.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pictures/blog/2023-02-12/2023-02-12 demo features so far.gif" alt="Combat platformer demo: warrior runs, jumps and slashes a slime" /></p>

<p>I managed to port most of my code for character control/animation from an <a href="https://github.com/hsandt/flame-of-hope-godot/tree/master/Scripts">older project</a>. But it was top-view, so I still had to work more to get running and jumping to work.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I had with physics was a regression on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">move_and_slide</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/71993">this issue</a>). Otherwise, I’d say Godot’s built-in classes made it pretty simple. I don’t have any custom raycasts in my code so far.</p>

<p>So far I implemented the following features for the player character:</p>
<ul>
  <li>move and jump</li>
  <li>melee attack: can chain up to two slashes</li>
  <li>health system: get hurt and die</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to make this open source, but as it contains some copyrighted third-party assets (although free).
I may extract the scripts into some public submodule (as with my Unity projects) though, so stay tuned!</p>

It is about UE4 and has not been tested for UE5, however UE5 documentation shows that delegate macro names have not changed. Content has been adjusted to fix dead links and update links to their redirection, such as UE4 doc -&gt; UE5 doc.</em></p>

<p>Quite often, gameplay programmers need to hand over the task of creating scripted events to level designers. In Unreal, a common workflow is to define shared features in C++ and level-specific behaviors with Blueprints.</p>

<p>While it is possible to implement C++ Actor methods via Blueprints using either <a href="https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Blueprints,_Empower_Your_Entire_Team_With_BlueprintImplementableEvent"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BlueprintImplementableEvent</code></a> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BlueprintNativeEvent</code>, in this post, I’ll talk about <strong>dynamic multicast delegates</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="concept">Concept</h1>

<p>Delegates allow you to handle functions as objects, pass them around and execute them later with the appropriate context. There are various ways to implement them in C++ (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9568150/what-is-a-c-delegate">this discussion on stack overflow</a> and <a href="https://nikitablack.github.io/post/generic_c++_delegates/">this proposition of Generic C++ delegates</a>), and Unreal provides its own implementation (see <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/delegates-and-lamba-functions-in-unreal-engine/">Delegates</a> in UE documentation). I won’t try to explain how they work in UE (getting myself lost among all the macros in the source code) but I’ll show you how to use them in a very specific case.</p>

<p>Imagine we have several Actors that share the same behaviors via <strong>Actor Components</strong>. Both Actors and Actor Components are initially defined in C++, but only Actors are extended via Blueprints (to reduce the number of Blueprints).  Behaviors are defined as C++ methods in the Actor Components’ classes, but since those are not derived into Blueprints, we cannot use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BlueprintImplementableEvent</code> nor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BlueprintNativeEvent</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UFUNCTION</code>s to move the implementation to a Blueprint event graph.</p>

<p>Instead, we declare a <strong>dynamic multicast delegate member</strong> in the Actor Component (called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwitchableComponent</code>) and bind a function (actually a Blueprint graph) to that delegate in the <strong>Actor’s Blueprint</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="code">Code</h1>

<h2 id="actor-component">Actor Component</h2>

<p>Below is an example on how to do that with a switch and a delegate for functions that takes 1 boolean parameter (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> to switch on).</p>

<p>Note that we need a <strong>dynamic</strong> delegate because dynamic delegates are serializable, which allows them to be saved in the Blueprints. I’m not sure why <strong>multicasts</strong> delegates are required, maybe it’s because they support multiple function bindings or because they don’t have return values. Anyway, if you try to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DECLARE_DYNAMIC_DELEGATE_OneParam</code> you’ll get the following error: <em>‘BlueprintAssignable’ is only allowed on multicast delegate properties.</em></p>

<h2 id="binding">Binding</h2>

<p>At first, the buttons in the Events section should all show a “+”. We click on the button next to <em>On Switch</em> to create the event node below (from then on, the button will show “View” as on the screenshot above):</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may right-click in the Event Graph area and type “Add On Switch” in the search field (ensuring SwitchableComponent is still selected and Context Sensitive is checked).</p>

<p>From here, we can bind a Blueprint graph to the OnSwitch delegate (represented by an event node) defined earlier in C++. In this example, we play a Sequence from a Sequence Actor reference we added directly as a Variable in the Actor Blueprint.</p>

<p>When the player character tries to interact with the Wall Switch, the level sequence plays:</p>

<p>The red/green box you see is a Box Trace with visual debug that the Player Character uses to detect interactables. It’s quite easy to do with Blueprints but may be tricky in C++, I’ll explain how this works in another post.</p>

<p>The OnSwitch event node that appeared seems to be a convenience node provided by the Event Graph when handling a delegate on an Actor Component (BlueprintImplementableEvents also show such nodes). But in general, you can bind events to delegates by creating a Custom Event with its own subgraph and assigning it to the Event input pin of the <em>Bind Event to …</em> node (type “Assign” in the Blueprint search box and you’ll find an action that generates both the Custom Event and the Bind Event node for the delegate you want, provided it is accessible from the current Blueprint or you have selected it in the World Viewport).</p>

<p>For instance, I selected a Wall Switch instance in the Viewport, then in the Level Blueprint editor I right-clicked &gt; Assign to OnSwitch. This allowed me to add an extra logging event when the Wall Switch was pressed (the multi-cast delegates will trigger <strong>all</strong> bounds functions/events on Broadcast).</p>
