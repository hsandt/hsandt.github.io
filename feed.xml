I’m regularly downloading new snapshots of Godot 4 beta which sometimes introduces breaking API changes, but I hope it will be worth it when it finally gets released.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pictures/blog/2023-02-12 demo features so far.gif" alt="Combat platformer demo: warrior runs, jumps and slashes a slime" /></p>

<p>I managed to port most of my code for character control/animation from an <a href="https://github.com/hsandt/flame-of-hope-godot/tree/master/Scripts">older project</a>. But it was top-view, so I still had to work more to get running and jumping to work.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I had with physics was a regression on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">move_and_slide</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/71993">this issue</a>). Otherwise, I’d say Godot’s built-in classes made it pretty simple. I don’t have any custom raycasts in my code so far.</p>

<p>So far I implemented the following features for the player character:</p>
<ul>
  <li>move and jump</li>
  <li>melee attack: can chain up to two slashes</li>
  <li>health system: get hurt and die</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to make this open source, but as it contains some copyrighted third-party assets (although free).
I may extract the scripts into some public submodule (as with my Unity projects) though, so stay tuned!</p>
