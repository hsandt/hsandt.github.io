Hello! I am a game developer from France with 3 years of professional experience working in a company and 3 years working on personal projects.

My main focus is gameplay programming, along some UI and tool programming. I also work on game design, writing and some pixel art on my personal projects.

Company projects are listed below.

For personal projects, have a look at my [itch.io](https://komehara.itch.io/).

For my works in progress, check out my [blog](/blog/).
