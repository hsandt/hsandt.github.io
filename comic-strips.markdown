I'm writing comic strips (mostly 3/4-panels) about general dev, game dev, and sometimes daily life. I'm gradually filling this page with old strips I've already drawn (on paper), and new strips (mostly digital). The strips are broadly sorted by drawing date, starting with the most recent ones.

You can click on them to see them bigger, and sometimes with an extra comment.
