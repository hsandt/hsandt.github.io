This is a collection of comic strips I've drawn about general dev, game dev, and sometimes daily life. I started doing this while working at a AAA studio, to kill time during very long builds... Then I continued outside the office too (although Godot doesn't leave me much time for that!)

I'm gradually filling this page with old strips I've already drawn (on paper), and new strips (mostly digital). The strips are broadly sorted by drawing date, starting with the most recent ones.

You can click on them to see them bigger, and sometimes with an extra comment.
