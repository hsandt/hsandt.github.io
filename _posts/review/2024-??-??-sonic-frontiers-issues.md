More than a review, this is a list of issues I found in Sonic Frontiers. Since the game has a pretty clear gameplay loop, I found most of the controls and UI issues in the first hours of playing. Later, I found more issues related to progression. After finishing the game once at any %, I got a compilation of issues that I am now posting here. I also noticed a few odd things about localization, although they all seem done on purpose.

To avoid spoilers, I will not mention issues specific to the ending (especially as the last DLC is apparently reworking it).

I also intend to work on some 3D prototype to try to reproduce and fix some of these issues, esp. related to control and UI - it would be harder to demonstrate how to fix progression on a small prototype, I could only give game design ideas on that.

Remember that because this is a list of issues, I focus on negative aspects, unlike a global review. Despite all these little problems, the game has been working for me, good enough so that I could finish it with much enthusiasm and little frustration. But all little problems are still worth studying, whether for the dev team to improve on their future games, or for other developers to ponder over.

# Gameplay

## Controls

## Progression

## Puzzle

Bonus mention for puzzles: most of them are quite easy, but the rotating pillars at the end of the first area, Kronos Island, was much harder than the rest. Instead of solving it by trial and error, I solved it mathematically. This will be the subject of another article.

# UI

# Localization
