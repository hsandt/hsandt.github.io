I decided to switch from a combat platformer where you fight many minions to **a single boss fight** where platforming is essentially to dodge boss attacks and find a right angle to counter-attack. I started drawing the first original sprites for the boss, so I could get exactly the character and projectile animations I needed.

### Gameplay

- Level: added 1 boss: the sorcerer
- Enemy AI: the sorcerer continuously shoots fireballs in the same direction

### Visual

- Character sprite: Sorcerer 2-frame Idle, 2-frame Hurt, 2-frame Die, 4-frame SpellForward (not used yet)
- Projectile sprite: Fireball 4-frame Move
