## Description

A collection of components and editor scripts that allow the  level designer to see the 2D collider of any object at any time, a  feature not natively available in Unity

## Features

- Always show 2D collider, even when the object is not selected (disable when you want)
- Support rotating and scaling the object or a parent
- Customize the color of the collider lines
- For Edge and Polygon 2D colliders, edit points directly by coordinates (this feature is now native since Unity 5.4)
- Inspector button to Round all coordinates to 1/16 px
- Also works in 3D view (displays the 2D colliders in perspective)

## Screenshots

## Source code

The link above targets the parent directory of the scripts. The individual scripts are:

- [EditBoxCollider2D.cs](https://github.com/hsandt/hyper-unity-commons/tree/develop/Runtime/Debug/EditBoxCollider2D.cs) : show a BoxCollider2D
- [EditEdgeCollider2D.cs](https://github.com/hsandt/hyper-unity-commons/tree/develop/Runtime/Debug/EditEdgeCollider2D.cs) and [EditEdgeColliderEditor.cs](https://github.com/hsandt/hyper-unity-commons/tree/develop/Runtime/Debug/Editor/EditEdgeCollider2DEditor.cs) : show and edit coordinates of an EdgeCollider2D
- [EditPolygonCollider2D.cs](https://github.com/hsandt/hyper-unity-commons/tree/develop/Runtime/Debug/EditPolygonCollider2D.cs) and [EditPolygonColliderEditor.cs](https://github.com/hsandt/hyper-unity-commons/tree/develop/Runtime/Debug/Editor/EditPolygonCollider2DEditor.cs) : show and edit coordinates of a PolygonCollider2D

The scripts depend on [GizmosUtil](https://github.com/hsandt/hyper-unity-commons/tree/develop/Runtime/Helper/Util/GizmosUtil.cs), a helper script I mainly wrote to support the 2D collider debug view.
