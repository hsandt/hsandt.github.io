## Description

Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 is the sequel of [Guns, Gore & Cannoli](https://www.rogueside.com/guns-gore-and-cannoli/){:target="_blank"}, an over-the-top run ‘n gun for 1-4 players by Crazy Monkey Studios (now [Rogueside](https://www.rogueside.com/){:target="_blank"}). The game’s campaign features the story of Vinnie, a gangster in the 1940s, over 16 levels from America to Europe. Vinnie can use a variety of melee and fire weapons to eliminate human threats, zombies and bosses. Since the previous game, GGC2 added many weapons, 360° aiming and online co-op.

## Context

I assisted Crazy Monkey Studios on gameplay and AI programming during my end-of-year internship as part of graduating requirements at Gobelins.

## Team

- Steven Verbeek: Production, Project management, UI and network programming
- Paul Rozie: Gameplay and network programming
- [Benjamin Claeys](http://claeysbrothers.be/): Art, Level design
- [Matthias Claeys](http://claeysbrothers.be/): Art, Animation, Audio, Level design

## Role

### Level design

I prototyped a level section made of a series of houses with leaking gas and fire:

- Whiteboxing
- Enemy spawn and destructible placement
- Event trigger and interactive switch placement

### Gameplay programming

I programmed the bomber enemy:

- Airplane movement
- Randomized bombing pattern

### UI programming

I worked on the input hint system for the tutorial sections:

- Display keyboard, mouse or gamepad button icons based on current input device

### Tool programming

I improved existing tools:

- More readable debug text

### Misc

- Minor physics optimization
